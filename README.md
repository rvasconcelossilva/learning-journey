# Learning Journey

This repository contains the technologies and sample of solutions that I developed in my journey to get more skills in data. Currently, I have experience in SQL, Microsoft SQL Server, SQL Server Integration Services and Power BI, and my goal is to get more experience in Scala, Apache Spark and Google Cloud Services, AWS and Azure which I worked embedding Power BI in webapplications and used Azure SQL Server.

# Python

In this project contains applications to practice my knowlodege in Python integrated with others technologies such as API's, Cloud and Spark.

# scala

This project contains solution of exerises of the below trainings and the focus is to learn syntax and the structure of Scala.

# spark-projects

This project is to focus on Spark technology using Scala or Python. I choose to work with Scala instead of Java or Python because of looking at the Data Engineer market plus the integration of this language with the other platforms I think there is a good fit.

# Google Cloud, AWS and Azure

Coming soon! I will follow the data paths in those platforms.
